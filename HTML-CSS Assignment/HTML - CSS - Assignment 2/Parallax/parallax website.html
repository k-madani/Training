        <h2>ASL Trio</h2>
       <p>The world reels from the death of Whitebeard, causing pandemonium on a global scale. Luffy's mind and body are in critical condition, having not only endured infiltrating and escaping from Impel Down and battling through the Marines and Warlords of the Sea at Marineford, but having all of his work come to naught due to Ace's death. Boa Hancock leads the Heart Pirates and the rest of Luffy's allies to take him to Amazon Lily, where he may recuperate in peace. As the Marines steadily recover from their great battle, Sengoku learns that the World Government is taking disturbing courses of action.

        Luffy begins to come to terms with his brother Ace's death, which leads to a flashback of when he met Ace and his friend Sabo for the first time. After being consoled by Jinbe, Luffy remembers that he still has his crew and expresses his desire to see them again.</p>
